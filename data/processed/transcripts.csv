It really does I have about a decade of international development experience and I know that a home has the power to change Entire communities in a way that very very few other investments can And our donors love that a hundred percent of all donations go directly to the needs and once home is built We send each and every donor a video of that exact family for full accountability.

VGXkghBFtL0,1,2023,"Hey, I'm Ronik, and I'm Adi. We met four years ago studying computer science at MIT, and we're both second-time founders. And now, Ronik and I are building Remembral, a developer tool that gives large language models, access to longer-term memory. We built Remembral about three weeks ago, after I was struggling with a couple of different LMB side projects I was working on. It was really just for personal use, but I decided on a whim to tweet about it, and it got an insane response with hundreds of thousands of views. I realized I was on a something with memory management, and other people probably had this problem too. That one tweet led to nearly 300 people reaching out, and asking to use Remembral for a really wide variety of use cases. We've realized that remembering details about the user fundamentally changes the user experience for these AI products. It allows you to turn the unstructured user data into actionable user profiles. And this means more personal conversations with chatbots. It means co-pilots that are better equipped to serve your needs and a lot more. We found that already 88% of AI founders are using retrieval as part of their LM stack, and they say it will continue to be a really important piece of the puzzle. Remembral can help empower builders to go even further with memory, and we'd really love to join this upcoming YC batch as we build that feature.",62.90692138671875,69.58901977539062,0.005861111111111111,1.7520454592174954,10

I'm graduating Stanford GSB in June, and before that I was a classroom teacher in Baltimore, and I'm Claire, and I was a high school teacher in her five years in New Orleans. We met last fall at a startup weekend EDU, where we were drawn together by our passion for changing education, and we ended up winning the weekend with a product called Mindful K12. Mindful K12 is a five to ten minute mindfulness curriculum that can be delivered in any teacher's classroom through WebAsap. We are passionate about this because we have seen firsthand the corrosive effects of toxic stress in the classroom. And this isn't just about inner city kids in Baltimore, or higher income students in Palo Alto. This is everybody. Half of teenagers feel overwhelmed by stress on a daily basis, and research shows that mindfulness makes a difference. Mindfulness helps the parts of the brain that increase problem solving, decision making, and emotional and behavioral regulation. So we want to get mindfulness into as many classrooms as possible. And this is where our wide combinator would really help us. Social motion learning is gaining huge traction across the board, and we're going to launch a full school full year curriculum next fall, and we feel you would help us reach at more classrooms.

aXiu5zdQnTw,0,2016,"YC, it's hard being human. Hey YC, I'm Nathan. And I'm Brennan, and with the co-founders of Nightly. Nightly is an app that automatically creates and grades assignments for teachers. Imagine a teacher has a reading that she wants her students to do. She can paste it in, and assignment is automatically created, and when her students complete the questions, those are automatically graded. So I was actually a teacher in Oakland, and what I experienced is that there are really two big challenges to being a teacher. On the one hand, you're dealing with people, which is your students, other teachers, parents, administrators. And on the other hand, you're dealing with this mountain of paperwork, which could include creating assignments and spending hours and hours creating papers. So we spent the last year actually trying to solve the people problem. We built an intelligence study tool that tried to have conversations, that adapted quiz difficulty. But the more feedback we got, the more we saw that a software substitute for the people element for humans wasn't coming anytime soon. On the other hand, we realized that we could apply a lot of these same techniques to this paper challenge, to automating the paperwork that teachers are performing. So our goal of nightly is to let software do what it can do well, and ultimately free teachers to do what they can do well. And that's work face-to-face with their students. We think this is going to be hugely valuable. I know I would have loved to have a tool like this when I was a teacher, and we think it's a really great technical challenge to be working on. So we're looking forward to maybe working on it with you guys, and we hope to see you in April. See you in April. Okay. Have a fun long day.

So think of it this way, imagine that you'd lend money to your favourite business during the term of that loan, you'd always go back to that business because you'd lend the money.

Our company as a spin-off of Carnegie Mellon University created to fundamentally change how people play music. Learning to play musical instrument is in fact difficult, while summer trying to make it easier, by even the most conservative estimates, four of every five students who begin playing this year will quit before the year is done. We demonstrated our first ARP and learning citizen over the state and abroad from hundreds of users feedback. We figured out that people they don't want to put in a time to learn an instrument. So instead of changing their behavior, we decided to adapt to it. It is possible with augmented reality, by providing a new AR instrument limitation, user can easily follow along and then play the simplified version of the song, which they like without any prior musical knowledge. So as a quick example, perhaps you want to be able to play your fiancé's favorite song on your wedding day. Music everywhere provides the tool to allow you to do just that instantly.

Well, Excursion is an Augment Reality Ad Platform connecting sponsors and publishers, giving the publishers the ability to display 3D ads in the form of 3D models in their Augment Reality application, specifically on the iOS and Android platform, due to the advent of Augment Reality technologies released by both Google and Apple recently, such as ARKit and ARCORE.

To investigate this further, we did a survey of around 80 food delivery platform users and we found that a lot of them shared the same views as us. In fact, around one third of them have never ordered an item on a food delivery platform when there was no image of it. We interviewed delivery platforms and restaurants and realized that the reason why this could change is because food photography is expensive and time consuming. In fact, restaurants with images in delivery platforms have 35% more orders than other restaurants. And we decided to build a platform in which restaurants can upload around 10 to 15 smartphone images of their menu item and then generate professional visuals based on their preferences, related to content, style and background.

I'm a current student at UF, a former college athlete, and I handle all of the operations, marketing, and customer support. So every football season, hundreds of thousands of fans struggle to find parking in Canesville, ultimately having to settle for overpriced spots that put them miles away from the stadium. Meanwhile, local property owners stand outside, holding up cardboard signs, and have to manually funnel cars into their lot. Perch bridges this gap. Proper owners can list their spots in advance for fans to pre-reserve, completely streamlining the process on both sides. Yep, last year we did about $3,000 in reservations just due to a single Facebook post and some fake parking tickets that we use as flyers. This year, we're four games into the 2023 football season. We've done over 800 reservations for $50,000 in gross merchandise value and fans rave every single day about how much we improve their game day experience. But for us, college football parking is just the beginning, we want to take this solution and scale it across the globe to other locations and venues, and we would love YC's help in getting there.

And AMIA is the solution we come up with for the problems we're facing. The problem is when I try to ask my friend out, so we try to ask his friend out. Often times, we get rejected because the schedule then moved and then we hang out at the time. And with AMIA, you can ask your friends out without the fear of that rejection because we try to eliminate those friction in hanging out together. So for example, if you just found a new restaurant, an interesting one, you can just share that on AMIA so that your friends can look at them and say, Oh, this sounds like a good idea. They may share. You don't have to invite all of your friends again and again and again. And also like when you share it up and you look at your friend list, you know which of your friends also want to go to a restaurant tonight. And you can contact those people and you know for sure they're in the mood and they're afraid to do that. Thank you.",147.88690185546875,79.52017974853516,0.010963216145833333,17.882561206817627,10

Yeah, so we went out to talk to users about how we can improve in a context that made sense to restaurant owners since COVID hit them really hard. After interviewing 100 restaurant owners and talking to users, here's what we found. All restaurant owners want is more foot traffic and direct orders, and users want cheap food and want to know exactly what to get in seconds, just like before. So users in our revamped app would swipe to explore local restaurants and deals in a Tinder-like format, and they would get personalized restaurant recommendations based on our prediction and data. We also partnered with more than 50 restaurants in Toronto to offer exclusive deals to app users with many more to come.

And we're creating the first generation of true digital workers that automate job functions from end to end and calling them artisans. So all of the settings and requests can be handled by chatting directly to the agent. So the LLM is really at the core of the product and then it queries the tools in order to automate much of the repetitive tasks and more of the uses. So we like to say that while other companies are putting AI into the assess, we put assess into AI. Exactly. And our first artisan is called Ava. She also makes the entire art balance sales process. You set Ava up with a five minute back and forth conversation. We like to say it's so easy that a 70-year-old who's never had a sales force could set Ava up. And people just love the idea. Whenever we mention it, someone in sales, they start chasing us to get Ava to access to the product. And the beautiful thing about sales rep is that we can use the sales rep on our behalf as a free employee for essentially eating our own dog food. And then we can take the workflow from the sales rep and apply that to the next generation of agents that then just rapidly scale. Exactly.

Besides that, you can build your own chatboard without the need to code. My name is Alexander Leinig, I'm 25 years old, and I dropped out of college when I was 19. But I do have eight years of business experience, found out my first company, a social media consultancy, where we held big brands with our Facebook and Twitter pages. I sold it in 2016, and that was the moment where we wanted to build Watermelon. And we have a very clear reason for that, because everything in society is 24-7 available, like your favorite shows with Netflix, or your favorite songs with Spotify. And that was the reason customer care should be 24-7 available as well. It is not possible for a lot of companies to have a lot of people running around 24-7, so a chatbot is the perfect fit. So we're very different than any other chatbot management platform. We already have all the channels in place, like Facebook, WhatsApp, email, etc. You don't have to code at all, so you can easily put in content, and the chatbot will learn from that, and also our machine learning algorithm has been built by ourselves. Our customers are PepsiCo, Nutrition, Domino Speeds, AS, mostly based in Europe and a few in Asia, and our obstacles are currently that we're not that scalable. So we have a very good business, we have nice clients, we can provide very good chatbots, but yeah, we're not scalable, we can provide a thousand customers a day with a new chatbot.

We want to organize the chaos of online work. Right, which alone is pretty cool. I think there are a lot of unorganized assets out there with more than 600 million people using online drive. So that's a lot and packs can organize all of it like a breeze. And packs can do even more than that. A pack is like a web page, but better. It's an online drive with the style UI.

-S83fysRwn4,1,2013,"Hi, I'm Parker Conrad. I'm founder of Zenefits. Zenefits is a platform for small businesses to manage insurance and benefits, primarily health insurance. And one way to think about this is that we're trying to replicate or actually really improve on everything that a small group commercial insurance broker does for their clients. And that starts with sick integrations into payroll systems that lets us pull out all the key HR data about a company and its employees so that you don't have to sort of write out all that information and pencil on a form that's been faxed to you by your insurance broker. And then we integrate with all the insurance carriers so that we can get you instant quotes. And then if you enroll in an policy, we can log back into your payroll system and set up all the deductions correctly so that things go smoothly next time you run payroll. And what the end goal here is released that as a company founder or HR person or what have you, you never have to think about this again. It just works and you don't have to worry about it. And there are a couple of interesting things about this business. The first is that the state of technology and insurance industry is just woefully behind the times. And I truly believe that we can do a much better job. There's nothing that an insurance broker does that we can't do better in software because we can personalize advice to you and your situation and your employees situations rather than sort of speaking in generalities. But the second sort of interesting thing is that starting in 2014, commissions are going to start coming down on health insurance for insurance brokers as a result of provisions in Obama and the Obamacare legislation. And insurance brokers have been complaining for years that they don't make enough money on their small group clients. And so a lot of them are saying that starting in 2014, they're either going to stop working with small groups or they're going to start charging a per-member per month administration fee. So one of the really interesting things here is that I could be launching this product at a time when the wheels are really coming off the cart for the existing solutions in the marketplace. A bit about me and my background. Before this company, I was co-founder and head of product at SIGFIG, which is the world's largest online financial advisor by AUM, about $40 billion when I left the company. And there I manage the team that built our SIG integrations. So I have a lot of experience with building that stuff. We built it from scratch, which is obviously really useful for the current venture. And you maybe wonder if you're thinking yourself, well, where are the other co-founders? Are they sort of hiding sort of just out of frame here or something? And I am a solo founder right now, but I won't be for long. I have a non-recruit provision with my former company that lasts until the end of October. And there are like two or three real rock star folks that I want to recruit into this latest company that I think all have a good chance of getting. And so hopefully by the time the product starts, this will be sort of a three or four person company instead of one person company today. Thanks.
